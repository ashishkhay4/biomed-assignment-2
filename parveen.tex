\section*{1. WHAT IS EVOLUTION OF HEALTH ?}
Evolution and its elements of natural selection, population migration, genetic drift, and founder effects have shaped the world in which we practice public health. ... Molecular mechanisms of differential resistance or susceptibility to infectious agents or diets have evolved and are being discovered with modern methods.

\section*{2. WHY IS EVOLUTION IMPORTANT?}
Understanding evolution helps us solve biological problems that impact our lives. To control hereditary diseases in people, researchers study the evolutionary histories of the disease-causing genes. ... In these ways, a knowledge of evolution can improve the quality of human life.
\section*{3. TYPE OF HEALTH CARE :}
\section*{1.Primary Health Care:}
Primary health care (PHC) is the first level of contact for individuals, the family, and the community with the national health system and “addresses the main health problems in the community, providing health promotion, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services accordingly.”

\section*{2.Pharmacy:}
The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to health care, including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information.

\section*{4.  HEALTH CARE FINANCING:}
In most countries, there is a mix of all five models, but this varies across countries and over time within countries. Aside from financing mechanisms, an important question should always be how much to spend on health ccare. For the purposes of comparison, this is often expressed as the percentage of GDP spent on health care.
\section*{5.  CONCLUSION  :}
The health care system refers to the institutions, people and resources involved in delivering health care to individuals. ... Indeed, this relation- ship between patient care and public health functions is one of the defining characteristics of the primary health care approach.Also called an Explanation of Benefits (EOB), the Health Care Summary is a quick and easy way to see the care you and your family got, and who pays what. Plus ways to save money and stay healthy.
